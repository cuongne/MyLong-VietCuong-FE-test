Here's a well-structured README file to help set up a React + Vite.js project with JSON-Server, including running the frontend and JSON-Server concurrently.

# React + Vite.js with JSON-Server

This project demonstrates how to set up a React application using Vite.js alongside a mock API server powered by JSON-Server. You'll be able to run the frontend and backend concurrently for a seamless development experience.

---

## **Getting Started**

### **Prerequisites**
Ensure you have the following installed on your system:
- **Node.js** (v18 or later)
- **Yarn** (v1.22 or later)

---

### **Installation**

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-folder>
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   yarn install
   ```

---

## **Scripts**

### **1. Start the Frontend**
To run the React frontend:
```bash
yarn run dev
```
- This will start the Vite development server, typically accessible at `http://localhost:5173`.

### **2. Start the JSON-Server**
To run the mock API server:
```bash
yarn run server
```
- By default, JSON-Server runs at `http://localhost:3001`.
- The database file is located in `db.json`.

---


## **Development**

1. Modify the `db.json` file to update your mock data.
2. Use the `fetch` API or libraries like `axios` in your React app to connect to the JSON-Server.

---

## **Troubleshooting**

- If `yarn run dev` or `yarn run server` fails, ensure there are no port conflicts on `5173` or `3001`.
- Check `vite.config.js` if you encounter CORS issues.
